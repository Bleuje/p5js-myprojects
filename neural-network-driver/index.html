  <h2> Neural network driver </h2>
</div>

<div class="container">
 <p>This is a bot that tries to cross checkpoints as fast as possible. Not the best thing ever but it works with little computation time.</p>
 <p>At each time step it can change its thrust by a new value between 0 and 200 units/timestepÂ² (one unit = 25 pixels)
 and change its orientation with a maximum difference of 18 degrees. The speed is multiplied by 0.85 at each turn (friction).</p>
  <p>This bot makes decisions using a neural network (more information below) trained by supervised learning.
  I have many versions (many weights) and I'm afraid this is really not the best, but at least it works !</p>
  <p style="color: red">04/10/2016 Update : there was a big bug about the angle constraint, now it's more difficult and more realistic</p>

	<h3>Neural network architecture</h3>
 <p>The neural network had two layers with bias. The activation function is tanh.</p>
  <p>There are 9 inputs : they give the position of the 2 next checkpoints relative to the car. There are 2 outputs : chosen thrust and chosen angle difference.
  All those values have been rescaled between -1 and 1 for learning efficiency.</p>
	<h3>How it has been trained</h3>
	<p>This bot has been trained using the data collected from another bot I made on the website CodinGame.com.
	That bot uses prediction many turns in advance and optimization with simulated annealing.</p>
		<p>The training to get the neural network weights was done by using the simple Python library PyBrain.</p>
